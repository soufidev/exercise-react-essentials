# React Essentials

A beginner-friendly React project built as part of a learning course.  
It introduces core concepts like components, JSX, props, and state — all wrapped in a clean, interactive UI.

> ⚠️ This project was created for educational purposes during a React course.  
> 💡 All code was written from scratch by me — no templates, no copy-paste.
